FlatBuffers-Net
===============
FlatBuffers-Net is an implementation of [FlatBuffers](http://google.github.io/flatbuffers/)
for .Net.

Limitations
-----------
Metadata not supported at this time.

To Do
-----
* Annotations for synthesizing type models and .NET style serialization (ala protobuf-net).
* Support for metadata.
* A better parser, with better error messages and exceptions.
